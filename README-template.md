## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS utilizing flex

### What I learned

This challenge was a refresher for me on how to build a simple webpage utilizing pure HTML and CSS. Writing CSS from scratch was a bit challenging since it's been a long time. 

### Continued development

Although this was not a difficult challenge, it really forced me to brush up my CSS skills instead of heavily relying on CSS frameworks too much.
